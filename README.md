## 🗞 Information
These are the few things followed in the project:
* The app is following [MVVC(Model View ViewModel)](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/books/ios-swiftui/introducing-mvvm-into-your-swiftui-project) Architecture
* All the HTTPRequest made is done through [Asynchronous](https://www.raywenderlich.com/25013447-async-await-in-swiftui) calls
* All the Image/Card is Server fetched, thus we are using [AsyncImage](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/asyncimage) in it
* The app uses UserDefaults to store data

## 🧰 Outsourced Component
* We are using scroll view in the app and since scroll view doesnt support inbuit [refreshable](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/label/refreshable(action:)) thus we used a [custom scroll view](https://stackoverflow.com/a/65100922/13105622)
